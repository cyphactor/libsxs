* Updated the README from it's original template form so that it was all
applicable to this project.

* Implemented and Documented the sxs_inet_ntoa() function so there
exists a function to convert addresses in network byte order to
c-strings in dotted-quad format.

* Modified the sxs_recv_nbytes() function so that instead of return
SXS_UNKNOWN_ERROR when a peer cleanly closes the connection before
finished reading the requested number of bytes it now returns
SXS_ERRCONNCLOSED. I also modified the associated doxygen documentation
to list SXS_ERRCONNCLOSED as a possible error value and give a
description of it's meaning.

* Added the scripts/unix_herrs.in file and the scripts/sxs_errs.in files
so that there are inputs for two new grouping types of error messages.

* Modified the scripts/build_sxs_error_files.py script so that it also
generated a mapping between the unix h_errno values and unique SXS_
prepended values so that errors reported via h_errno could be reported
properly within functions that use h_errno rather than errno.

* Modified the scripts/build_sxs_error_files.py script so that it
defines all the errors from the scripts/sxs_errs.in file so that the sxs
library can have a mechanism for defining it's own unqique erros which
do not map to any of the standard ones. This is mainly done so that
extension functions added to the library can returne appropriate values.

* Modified the scripts/build_sxs_error_files.py script so that it
creates a macro for each mapping that defines the size of the mapping
array and uses it both in the header decleration and in the source files
assignment. It may also become useful in implementing the library as
doing such things as bounds checking in the sxs_perror() function and
similar functions that access the mapping.

* Modified the sxs_init() function to do proper error checking for the
WSAStartup() call and return the appropriate mapped error values. I also
updated the doxygen documentation for sxs_init() to list all the
possible error values and their associated meanings.

* Modified the sxs_uninit() function to do proper error checking for the
WSACleanup() call and return the appropriate mapped error values. I also
updated the doxygen documentation for sxs_uninit() to list all the
possible error values and their associated meanings.

* Modified the sxs_gethostbyname() function to do proper error checking
for the gethostbyname() function on the Unix side and return the
appropriate mapped error values. I also updated the doxygen
documentation for the sxs_gethostbyname() function to list all the
possible error values and their associated meanings.

* Modified the sxs_perror() function to take advantage of the new
unix_herr mapping as well as handle all the error type classes in a
better fashion and check for sxs error code range breaking.

* Modified the scripts/build_sxs_error_files.py to add documentation to
the SXS_SUCCESS and SXS_UNKOWN_ERROR values.

* Modified the sxs_perror() function to properly handle errnum values of
SXS_SUCCESS and SXS_UNKNOWN_ERROR, which I previously forgot to handle.

* Added doxygen documentation to the sxs_init() and sxs_uninit()
functions.

* Modified the scripts/both_errs.in, scripts/unix_errs.in, and
scripts/win_errs.in files so that they use doxygen style documentation
for describing the meanings of all the defines which actually represent
errors.

* Moved the sxs_error_t declaration to the sxs_types.h file from the
sxs_error.h file.

* Added some more doxygen comments to the src/sxs_types.h file to
clarify the available types as well for general completeness.

* Added some doxygen comments to the src/sxs_types.h file to clarify the
available types as well os for completeness.

* Correted the @retval SXS_SUCCESS doxygen documentation lines for a
number of functions that had improper documentation due to copy and
paste errors.

* Modified the Doxyfile to fix the destination location of the
documents. It was originally specified as doc/doxs which was incorrect.
It was corrected to doc/dox.

* Modifide all the files in src/ so that the documentation used the @
preceding keywords rather than a \. I did this for consistancy reasons
and so that it matched the doxygen documentation styles appropriately.

* Modified the scripts/build_sxs_error_files.py to output code with the
proper doxygen documentation style in it.

* Modified the clean_bootstrap.sh file so that it properly removes the
automatically generated src/sxs_config.h and src/sxs_config.h.in files.

* Created the doc/ directory so that there is a location in the project
tree for keeping documentation.

* Created the doc/dox/ directory so that there is a location to have the
doxygen generated documenation placed when doxygen is run from the
trunk.

* Created the Doxyfile in the main trunk so that doxygen can be run from
the trunk and the documentation will be generated and placed into the
doc/dox/ directory.

* Created the ChangeLog file so that there is a place to track changes
to the lib_sxs source tree.

* Created the initial COPYING file to provide the license information.

* Created the initial NEWS file so there exists a place to put project
news.

* Created the initial INSTALL file to describe the standard INSTALL
process with the build system.

* Created the initial AUTHORS file to list the authors of lib_sxs.

* Created the initial TODO file so there is a place to put a list of
items which need to be taken care of. Mainly, as a quick reminder
location for something I could forget.

* Created the src/ directory as the main location for having the source
code for lib_sxs.

* Created the bootstrap.sh script to automate the generation of the
configure script.

* Created the initial configure.ac as a basic template to build off of
for the build environment.

* Created the lib_sxs root Makefile so that it would build the source in
the src/ directory.

* Created the clean_bootstrap.sh script to cleanup all the extra files
produced by the autoconf, automake, autoreconf, and libtool
applications.
