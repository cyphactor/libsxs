* Created the ChangeLog file so that there is a place to track changes
to the lib_sxs source tree.

* Created the initial COPYING file to provide the license information.

* Created the initial NEWS file so there exists a place to put project
news.

* Created the initial INSTALL file to describe the standard INSTALL
process with the build system.

* Created the initial AUTHORS file to list the authors of lib_sxs.

* Created the initial TODO file so there is a place to put a list of
items which need to be taken care of. Mainly, as a quick reminder
location for something I could forget.

* Created the src/ directory as the main location for having the source
code for lib_sxs.

* Created the bootstrap.sh script to automate the generation of the
configure script.

* Created the initial configure.ac as a basic template to build off of
for the build environment.

* Created the lib_sxs root Makefile so that it would build the source in
the src/ directory.

* Created the clean_bootstrap.sh script to cleanup all the extra files
produced by the autoconf, automake, autoreconf, and libtool
applications.
